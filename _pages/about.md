Hi! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of
California, Davis. I work with my advisor [Dr. Hamed Pirsiavash](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hpirsiav/)
on interesting computer vision problems with a focus on self-supervised representation learning from images. I obtained my M.Tech (Research) degree
in Computational Data Science at the Indian Institute of Science
(IISc) where I was advised by [Prof. Venkatesh
Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/).
I obtained my B.Tech degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka (NITK).
