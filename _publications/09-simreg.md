title: 'SimReg: Regression as a Simple Yet Effective Tool for Self-supervised
Knowledge Distillation'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/09-simreg
excerpt: 'In SimReg, we show that simple regression works as well as more
complex state-of-the-art methods on self-supervised knowledge distillation.
We find that using an additional MLP-head atop the CNN base architecture, even
if only during the train stage, results in superior performance on downstream tasks.'
