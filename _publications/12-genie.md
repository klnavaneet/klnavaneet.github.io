title: 'GeNIe: Generative Hard Negative Images Through Diffusion'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/12-genie
excerpt: 'GeNIe is a data augmentation technique for image classification.
It leverages a diffusion model conditioned on
a text prompt to merge contrasting data points (an image
from the source category and a text prompt from the tar-
get category) to generate challenging samples for the tar-
get category. Inspired by recent image editing methods, we
limit the number of diffusion iterations and the amount of
noise. This ensures that the generated image retains low-
level and contextual features from the source image, po-
tentially conflicting with the target category.'
