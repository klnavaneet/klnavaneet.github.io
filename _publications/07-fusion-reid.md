title: 'Operator-in-the-Loop Deep Sequential Multi-camera Feature Fusion for
Person Re-identification'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/07-fusion-reid
excerpt: 'We propose a novel framework for multi-camera person
re-identification. We introduce a human-in-the-loop methodology to sustain or
improve re-id performance as images from more cameras are integrated.'
