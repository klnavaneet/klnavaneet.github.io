title: 'Compact3D: Compressing Gaussian Splat Radiance Field Models with
Vector Quantization'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/13-comp3d
excerpt: 'Compact3D is a method to compress 3D Gaussian Splat models.
We notice that many Gaussians in 3DGS share similar parameters, so
we introduce a simple vector quantization method based on
K-means algorithm to quantize them.
Then, we store the small codebook along with the index of
the code for each Gaussian. Moreover, we compress the
indices further by sorting them and using a method similar to run-length encoding.'
