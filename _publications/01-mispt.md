title: 'Multiple spectral peak tracking for heart rate monitoring from photoplethysmography signal during intensive physical exercise'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/01-mispt
excerpt: 'This paper is on effectively predicting heart rates from PPG signals
in the presence of significant motion artefacts. We show that using multiple
initialization points in spectral peak tracking provides a robust estimate of
the heart rate.'
