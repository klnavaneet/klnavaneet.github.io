title: 'Constrained Mean Shift Using Distant Yet Related Neighbors for
Representation Learning'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/10-cmsf
excerpt: 'CMSF extends a prior self-supervised
representation learning method(MSF) where a sample is encouraged to be close to
not just its augmented version but also to the nearest neighbors of the
augmented image. In CMSF, the neighbors are constrained to be from the same
semantic category as the input image. Use of constraint provides samples that
are far from the target image in the feature space but close in the semantic
space. The category labels are present in the
supervised set-up and are predicted in the semi- and self-supervised
set-ups.'
