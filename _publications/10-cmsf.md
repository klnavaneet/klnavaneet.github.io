title: 'Constrained Mean Shift Using Distant Yet Related Neighbors for
Representation Learning'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/09-simreg
excerpt: 'CMSF extends a prior contrastive loss based self-supervised representation learning method(MSF) where a sample is encouraged to be close to not just its augmented version but also to the nearest neighbors of the augmented image. In CMSF, the neighbors are constrained to be from the same semantic category as the input image. The category labels are present in the supervised set-up and are predicted in the semi- and self-supervised set-ups.'
