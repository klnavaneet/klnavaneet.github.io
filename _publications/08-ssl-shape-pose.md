title: 'From image collections to point clouds with self-supervised shape and
pose networks'
collection: publications
teaser: publications/08-ssl-shape-pose
excerpt: 'We aim to reconstruction 3D point clouds from single image inputs in
a self-supervised manner. The input RGB image and corresponding foreground mask
are used as supervisory signals in the absence of supervised 3D, multi-view 2D or pose information.'
